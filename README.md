If you are here, you are probably looking for ways to get CloudCherry data into R for the purpose of more extensive manipulation using the full range of libraries available in R. 

This package is not yet on CRAN. To install the latest development version you can install from the cloudcherry github repository:

``` r
# latest version from Github
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
install_github('getcloudcherry/cloudcherry-r-sdk', force = T)
```
